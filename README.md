# ELT Pipeline for NE Cars (Work in Progress)

An ELT pipeline using dbt, AWS Redshift and Apache Airflow, for a local used car dealership.

This is a migration project, moving the original Snowflake implementation ([necars-elt-pipeline-sf](https://github.com/dulle90griet/necars-elt-pipeline-sf/)) to a Redshift warehouse.

For more information (for now), see that implementation.
